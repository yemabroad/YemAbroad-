    <div class="area">
      As a Yemeni student, your journey to studying in the United States involves several important steps that can be summarized in:
         </div>
      <ul class="list1">
       <li>Selecting colleges</li>	
       <li>Submitting college admission applications</li>
       <li>Applying for financial aid</li>
       <li>Attending interviews and applying for a visa if accepted</li>
     </ul>
        On this website, we will focus on the first three steps to help you get started.<br>
     <div class="important">
      Please note that while this guidance is applicable to all international students in general,  many of the specific instructions and processes are tailored for students living in Yemen, and may not work the same for your country.

     </ul>
 <div id="checklist" class="center1">Checklists</div>
   <div class="area">
   A checklist is essentially a spreadsheet where you record every task you’ve completed or plan to complete in the college application process. Think of it as your "Step Zero" to start your application. Checklists may include:
   </div>
   <ul class="list1">
    <li>Academic or extracurricular activities timeline.</li>	
    <li>Trainings or courses you are a part of.</li>
    <li>Webinars or sessions you will attend.</li>
    <li>Projects or personal initiatives.</li>
    <li>Deadlines for applications and tests (e.g., SAT, TOEFL, etc.).</li>
   </ul>
     <div class="area">
   Create a monthly checklist to track your progress. This will help you stay on schedule and ensure nothing is overlooked.<br>
  Here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VWdvj1WAUG-ByvVQBTB68EjrAKnGMJPb/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107123481125735966013&rtpof=true&sd=true">checklist sample</a> to get you started.
</div>

  <div id="college-search" class="center1">Selecting Colleges</div>
  <div class="area">
   You should not apply to random colleges you hear about casually. You should make a list of more than one college considering the following:
  </div>
   <ul class="list1">
   <li>Degree Type: Are you pursuing a bachelor’s, diploma, or master’s degree?</li>
   <li>Affordability: How much of your education cost will be covered? Is the scholarship fully-funded or partially-funded?</li>
   <li>Requirements: TOEFL or IELTS required scores or any other academic requirements</li>
   </ul>
   <div class="area">
     Avoid narrowing your search based on location, campus size, or academic programs, as this will limit your options.<br>
     Learn how to make your college list in the college search section.
  </div>
   <div id="applications" class="center1">Types of Applications</div>

   <div class="center2">Admission Application</div>
      <div class="area">
    This is your official request to be considered for enrollment at a college or university.
   There are two main ways to submit admission applications:
   </div>

   <ul class="list1">
   <li>Common App: A platform where you can apply to multiple U.S. colleges at once.</li>
   <li>The college’s official website: If it is preferred or does not charge an application fee, unlike on the Common App.</li>
   </ul>
      <div class="area">Learn how to fill out your Common App application in the Common App page.</div>
   <div class="center2">Financial Aid Application</div>
   <div class="area">
         This is your request for financial support to cover tuition, housing, and other expenses.
         There are three primary financial aid forms:
            </div>
         <ul class="list1">
         <li>CSS Profile: Used by many private colleges.</li>
          <li>ISFAA (International Student Financial Aid Application): A paper-based form used by colleges that don’t use the CSS Profile or do not offer fee waivers.</li>
          <li>FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid): available to U.S. citizens and certain eligible non-citizens. International students usually do not fill out FAFSA unless they meet eligibility criteria.</li>
          </ul>
         <div class="area">Learn more about each financial aid form on the financial aid page.</div>
